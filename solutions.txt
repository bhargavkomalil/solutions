angular
----------
1)index----->app---->service.ts ----> module.ts----->component.ts<----->template

2) routing is help to navigate one view to another view with out browsing applicaction ,
	import angular routermodule and connect the component paths to navigate one view to another view 
	by clicking the related link
3) through HttpClientModule we can interact with front end to backend

4) Initialization of application components and module at point is bootstrapign 

5) Httpclient is service to connect btw frontend to backend ,
	http is helps to work the functions of its HttpclientModule like inbuild methods

6) To animate the elements in browser css animation are for usefull by its element functionalitys like @keyframs
7) In my project i done with forms and footers part and one component and its child components
 	with bootstrap framework
8) by using mat tags in template and its api we have to import to build angular meterial design
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nodejs
-------

1) nodejs is server side code and it is non-blocking code , event rised functionality with its single threaded operation 

2) it is singel threaded and asynchronus by this natur so that it will never stop  its request and response 
	 if any blocking is there pass another one with out any fails , so it is fast and lightweight
 
3) event loop is ready to rise another event by complitin of one event     

4) callback function is raised at complition of given task , if there is no error was raised then first argument will pass as null 

5) In nodejs asnychronous functions will return the sychronously by promis methods
  
6) a callback function is raised at the end of its link function execution,it will executed after its relative function 

7) event emitters are used to transmit data from one component to another component and raise the events

8) written of code with more nested callback functionalitys with that its callback hell is happens ,
	by using the settime functionalitys we can avoid the callback hell 
9) with required('') module we can connect the diffent modules like mongoos , express , jwt in nodejs to perform operations
